# Creating magazines with LaTeX and Bonaparticle

**Using LaTeX to produce magazines that look just as well as those made using Adobe’s InDesign is way harder than it should be. You don’t want to mess around with arcane (La)TeX commands – you just want to create something that looks  nice, with as little effort as possible. Bonaparticle helps you do exactly that, by offering an easy to extend and use LaTeX class.**

## Built using Bonaparticle

### The Bonaparticle Chronicle (example)

The Bonaparticle Chronicle is a fictional magazine that covers news and sciencey things, and is compiled directly using `bonaparticle.cls`. This is not how you’re “supposed” to use the class, but it does demonstrate some of the basic features.

You can view the source and output in the [examples/plain/](examples/plain/)  folder of this repository.

### Vakidioot

The [Vakidioot](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/Vereniging/Commissies/vakid/) is a student-run bi-monthly magazine published by [A–Eskwadraat, the study association for students in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, and Information Science at Utrecht University](https://www.a-eskwadraat.nl/). Coincidentally, the Vakidioot also serves as the main beta tester of the Bonaparticle class.

An example of a Vakidioot article can be found in the [examples/vakidioot/](examples/vakidioot/) folder of this repository.

## Frequently asked questions

#### Why “Bonaparticle”? How does one even pronounce that?
Bonaparticle is an amalgamation of “(Napoléon) Bonaparte” and “article”. The Bonaparticle class is mainly intended for magazine _articles_ and the author of the class sometimes [plays as France in Sid Meier’s Civilization V](http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Napoleon_(Civ5)), but other than that, there’s no real reason for naming it Bonaparticle. Other names that were considered are “PolyTeX” (which would’ve been nice if this was developed at a [polytechnic university](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology), but it’s not), “CalTeX” (which would’ve been nice if this was developed at [Caltech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology), but that isn’t the case either), and the very generic and unassuming name “magazine”.

#### When can we expect some real documentation?
The first reasonably feature-complete and bug-free version isn’t expected until April 2016, so probably around then. If you are comfortable wading through LaTeX code, you can read the comments in `bonaparticle.cls` for now, or send me questions via email.
